#Why FairyGUI
Game UI production is a game development process in a heavy workload. The work includes the arrangement of resources, the realization of various controls and the preparation of response code, etc..<br/><br/>
UI editor in the market, have provided a certain number of components, but the game's needs are always changing, when the existing components can not meet the requirements, these editors usually have several ways to solve:<br/>
1, the use of the skin, change the appearance or layout of the control, but the degree of freedom is very few, not all the needs are just for a simple appearance.<br/>
2, modify the source code of the original control, or write code to extend the existing control. This means that programmers are involved in the design of art, and it is likely to lose WYSWYG, or even complex components that will be the way to achieve pure code.<br/><br/>
But FairyGUI can gracefully solve these things<br/><br/>
`FairyGUI provides three key technologies: controller, relation and extension, which makes almost all types of UI components can be directly created by the art designer in the editor, without the need to write code, no configuration file, flexible form, and the static effect and dynamic effect.`<br/>
